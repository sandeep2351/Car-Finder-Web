            Founded in 2020, RideHub is on a mission to revolutionize the way people find and purchase cars online.
          </p>

          <p>
            At RideHub, we believe that finding your perfect car should be an exciting journey, not a stressful chore.
            That's why we've built a platform that makes car shopping simple, transparent, and enjoyable. Whether you're
            a first-time buyer or a seasoned car enthusiast, our goal is to provide you with the tools and information
            you need to make confident decisions.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>

          <p>
            RideHub was born out of frustration with the traditional car buying process. Our founders, all car
            enthusiasts themselves, recognized that the industry was ripe for innovation. They set out to create a
            platform that would bring transparency, convenience, and joy back to car shopping.
          </p>

          <p>
            What started as a small startup with a handful of listings has grown into a comprehensive marketplace with
            thousands of cars from trusted dealers and private sellers across the country. Despite our growth, our
            mission remains the same: to help you find the perfect car with confidence and ease.
